The player launches with a randomized queue of your Apple Music songs, ready for shuffling. Whenever you select a song, whether from your songs list or one of your unique playlists, you'll see its details displayedâ€”giving you complete control over your listening experience.

#### SONGS LIST: Your Music, Ranked and Ready

Explore your music collection like never before. Our Songs List feature ranks your songs by play count by default, offering a glimpse into your favorites. Want to mix things up? Use the filter button to sort your collection by date added or last played, discovering old gems and new hits alike.

#### PLAYLIST LIST: Your Curated Collections

All your Cancion-generated playlists live here. It's your personal space to create new mixes or manage existing ones, ensuring your playlists evolve just as your musical tastes do.

#### SMART PLAYLIST GENERATOR: Where The Magic Happens

Unleash the power of your Apple Music library with our Smart Playlist Generator. Start with a name, and if you choose, a playlist cover image (don't worry, we'll create one for you if you prefer). Then, let the magic happen:

- **Filters:** Opt for "any" to include songs that match any of your chosen filters, or "all" for songs that meet all criteria. Combine filters like artist, title, play count, and dates added or played, with conditions including "is", "contains", "before", "after", and "greater than", to refine your selection.
- **Limit and Sort:** Control how many songs make it into your playlist, and in what order they appear. Whether it's by play count, artist name, or song title, you have the power to shape your playlist's narrative.
- **Live Updating:** Keep your playlists fresh with live updates every time you open them, ensuring they always reflect your current preferences and the latest in your music library.
